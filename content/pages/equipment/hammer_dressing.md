## Why should I do this?

The edges on the faces of most commercially produced hammers are sharp enough to leave marks on your workpiece if a strike lands at a small angle.
Found hammers that you wish to re-purpose or rescue from the rust pile may come with an overly rounded surface, an indented or tilted surface, or even have chips knocked out of them
Dressing your hammer will reduce the chance of these problems marring your work.

Experience and personal taste will eventuallly inform as to how much one should round off a hammer's edges.
A reasonable starting point is to create a radius of about 2 mm (1/8 inch) on the edges of a hammer that you intend to use to smooth a surface.

On a hammer that will be used to fuller (spread out) the work you might want to reprofile it to a rounded shape. The more convex (the rounder) you make it the more agressively it will move the metal.

Avoid using a double cut file for dressing as it will likely leave marks on the tool.
Someone with good filing technique may be able to dress a tool without needing to finish by sanding or grinding.

Flatters and Setters may also be dressed. 
Both need their striking surface to be absolutley flat, with the edges of the flatter rounded gradually from about 4 mm (1/4 inch) from the edge, and the edges of a setter to be made as square as possible.

Using a vise to hold the hammer as you work on it is recommended.
It is important to keep the striking surface perpindicular to the axis of the hammer.

When cleaning up a hammer will require a larger effort removing the handle can make it easier to clamp the hammer's head as you work on it.

Machine grinding will obviously speed up the dressing process, but one has to pay close attention to the grit used, and how the grinder is held to the tool.
A sandpaper grit of 120 or smaller value will leave scratches on the tool's surface that can affect the finish of the workpiece.
Tools for working softer metals (gold, aluminum etc.) should even be polished to as high as 500 grit to ensure success when planishing.

{{< notice warning >}}
Using machine assistance to dress surfaces correctly requires skill and stability to avoid harming the utility of a dressed tool.
The tool being dressed is best clamped, leveled, and arm supports used to hold the grinder perpindicular to the axis of the tool.
Using a flap wheel is not recommended as there is less control over the position and angle of grinding than with a belt or surface grinder.

## You Will Need

### Consumable Materials

- [ ] Sandpaper
- [ ] (Optional) flap discs, or grinder belts

### Equipment

- [ ] the hammer to be dressed
- [ ] flat, single cut file(s)
- [ ] (Optional) an angle grinder or belt grinder
- [ ] (Best Practice) a vise

## The Process

### Make sure the flat face is actually flat

Sometimes commercially produced hammers have a very slight indent on the flat face. Grind or sand the flat face down until it is flat.
Gluing a sheet of sandpaper onto a panel or table top and then rubbing the hammer head over it can make it easier to keep it vertical.

### Remove sharp edges

Most commercially produced hammers have sharp edges on their edges that should be smoothed and rounded off to mitigate the risk having them mark on your work.
