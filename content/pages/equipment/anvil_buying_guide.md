## Look for...

### Clean face

Anvil face should be smooth and flat, with crisp or rounded edges. Up to 1/8" of sway is desirable for straightening stock.

### Structural integrity

Anvil face and body should be fully intact and without cracks or significant chips.

### Vendor or weight markings

Lack of markings isn't inherently bad, but presence of them can give clues as to the weight and manufacturer.

## Avoid...

### Chipped edges

### Cracks

### Delamination

### Paint

### Cast iron
