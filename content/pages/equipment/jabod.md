## You Will Need

### Materials

- [ ] A box
- [ ] Some dirt (clay or loam, not sand)
- [ ] Blower (hairdryer or [duct fan][Air source recommenations])
- [ ] Dryer hose or similar heat resistant means of connecting your blower to your box
- [ ] Some [coal][]

### Equipment

- [ ] Hole saw or similar of the same size as the dryer hose
- [ ] Something to light your forge

## The Process

### Cut a hole in the box

Cut a hole in your box big enough for the hose to fit snugly

### Put your dirt in that box

Fill the box with dirt, forming a conical indent about 6 inches (15cm) in diameter and 4 inches (10cm) deep. This indentation will be your "fire box".

Ensure the pipe extends into the fire box and is unobstructed.

### Connect the blower

Connect the air source to the hose, and fit the hose to the hole in the box

### Light your new forge
