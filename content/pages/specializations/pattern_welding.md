## Pattern Welding Stainless Steel
The long and short of it is simply that the primary alloying element in Stainless Steel (Chromium) creates a rapid forming and stable oxide. This is great for nearly every application except for forgewelding. Why?

Well.

That oxide layer forms within minutes. You might be thinking to yourself "but I don't see an oxide layer!" aaaaand you'd be right, because it's so thin that it doesn't alter the light via thin film distortion as other oxide layers, such as temper colors, often times do.

Why is this an issue? These chromium oxides are obscenely stable and as such will not dissolve with standard flux like normal carbon steel oxides do.

You also have to take into account the fact that high alloy steels, such as stainless steel alloys, all have different rates of thermal expansion. Only certain steels are compatible with each other and even then you can run into cracking and splitting issues due to the differences in alloying content.

How does someone find success with forgewelding stainless steel?

1. Meticulous cleaning of your steel, the higher the final grit before encasing, the better.
I've found better success in utilizing a flat granite plate an sanding my bars to be stacked up to 800 grit and cleaning with degreaser then Dawn and warm water

1. Mitigation of time wasted with the steel exposed to the atmosphere to minimize the formations of oxides
Having your workflow prepared an moving quickly, or even setting up a small vacuum chamber to store your steel before you seal it up will increase your chances of success

1. Full enclosure airtight canister weld purge with Argon gas, or isostatic fusion TiG welded seams (Mig works for other people, not for me)
Oxygen is the destroyer of dreams when it comes to stainless welding. You need to keep everything airtight

1. Proper austenization soak times for atomic bonding
Depending on your billet size and your forge size, soak time can be anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.

1. Careful temperature control
Most people assume that you need high heat to get a good weld and that hotter is better. This is not the case. There is an inverse relationship with temperature and soak time. As your temperature increases, your soak time decreases, but you need to reduce the size of the bar by a greater degree to displace the grain boundaries. Lower temperature increases your soak time but decreases the amount of size reduction and grain boundary displacement necessary for the weld to take.

1. Time after welding
This goes for any forgeweld, but you need to age the weld in order for that diffusion bond to fully set. A 10-15 minute soak at temperature is generally recommended before any drastic deformation
