# Equipping your shop
## Basics
There are a large amount of tools at an armourer's disposal. This is a significant factor in armouring being such a difficult craft to master. However, it isn't so overwhelming as it seems- most tools seen aren't really necessary, and many are just for quality of life or can be substituted/made.
\

To get started, you'll need a minimum of a few tools. These are necessary, and are either required or must be substituted.
* Ball peen hammers- preferably several sizes. Polish the flat face and ball, they should be very smooth. The flat face should also be [dressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5wyhqKtnqo).
* Something to hit metal on. An anvil is preferred for the horn and heel, as well as the hardy- however, it is not *required.* There are plenty of substitutes for an anvil in other sections of the wiki.
* Related to the anvil, you will need dishing forms in order to actually create curvature in your armour. This can either be stumps or real metal dishes. This will be elaborated on further down.
* A vise. This is necessary for holding your work, especially while drilling. A post vise is preferred; however, I've made do with a machinist's vise.
* A drill press, for putting rivet and point holes through armour. Can be substituted for a drill, but it's much more intensive both in labor and patience. Use plenty of cutting oil and tungsten coated bits for the best results. HSS is fine, but it takes a little longer.
* For almost every piece of armour, you need some basic leatherworking. An awl and/or a hole punch are sufficient, if you intend to rivet your leather. If you want to sew it, you'll need needles and sinew, as well as an awl. You'll also need to learn how to attach a buckle.
* Something for rivets. I use roofing nails, it works fine. Use washers on the leather side to prevent it from tearing and fraying.
* Measuring tape, preferably a tailor's tape measure. If you want your armour to fit, anyway.
* Angle grinder with cutting disks OR beverly shears OR a round file and a *lot* of patience. (For cutting your armour patterns out.)
* Needle nose pliers. They aren't *specifically* required for anything, but I find them invaluable for their adaptability in the shop.
## Optional equipment (for beginners)
* Some form of black spray paint- recommended is Rustoleum
* Vise grips or tight tongs to hold smaller pieces while striking
* Soft jaw attachments for your vise and vise grips, to reduce hammer scarring and make the final piece prettier
* Wire brush wheel for angle grinder. I like it a lot for a lower grit polish.
* Trailer hitch- Works amazingly for planishing. Very polished, just make sure the top is ground flat and lock it into a vise. Quite cheap as well.
## Common pitfall
A common pitfall that a lot of beginner armourers make is thinking that they need much more equipment than you do. You don't need a variety of planishing hammers, or a stake anvil, or a kiln. And certainly not an oxy-acy torch. These things may be nice to have, but they are far from necessary (for most applications.) 
### Dishing stumps
You should aim for a perfectly round depression- my sharpie marks got jittery because of the uneven wood surface.
