# The holy grail of this section- The pattern archive.
[This page](https://www.armourarchive.org/patterns/) has many patterns for different pieces of armour, including most things that people commonly want to make.]
## Youtube Channels
* [Greenleaf Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/@GreenleafWorkshop)- Great resource for beginners and journeymen alike.
* [Armorysmith- How to Make Armor](https://www.youtube.com/@howtomakearmor)- Forges a lot of "fun" armour from movies and such that isn't exactly historical, but forges some good historical stuff too. Currently deployed in Ukraine, may never make another video.
* [Armorysmith- Art of Armor](https://www.youtube.com/@ArmorySmith) - Another of Armorysmith's channels
* [Armorysmith- World of Armor](https://youtube.com/@ArmorySmithWorkshop)- Another Armorysmith channel
* [Knyght Errant](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1T4KJG1L_kTrP9RcdU5Csw)- Altogether Renaissance youtuber. Makes a lot of videos about generalized historical study, but also has a decent amount of videos focused on armour and its composition/creation.

## Sources to AVOID.
* Shadiversity - Chronic misinformation, simply incorrect about a lot of things, going down some questionable moral pipelines, etc.
* Metatron- Similar youtuber. Questionable morality, in addition to blatant misinformation and misleading takes.
* Skallagrim- While much less egregious than the former 2, and also a much better person, much of the information presented in Skallagrim's videos is questionable. It's recommended not to take his claims as fact, and to take them with a grain of salt. His channel is mostly geared towards larpers and DnD players, rather than armourers or those genuinely pursuing historical scholarship.
* Anything that doesn't cite sources, such as extants, manuscripts, or treatises.
