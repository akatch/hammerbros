If you've made it this far, then you should be ready to make your first piece of armour. The starting project for a beginning armourer is a spaulder, the precursor to a pauldron. This section will walk you through that project, using images I took during the process of making my first spaulder and piece of armour when I began. Please note that these instructions are for making the armour out of mild steel, and thus do not mention anything related to heating, annealing, work-hardening, etc.
# Forming the plates
First, you want to download the patterns for the spaulders from the pattern archive, and then print them out. Cut the pieces out of the paper and use them to trace the pattern onto your sheet metal. You should resize these patterns to fit the measurements of your body, if you intend to wear them. The cop and lames should curve and cover about half of your arm's circumference, and the height should reach about halfway down your triceps.

Once you do this, you need to cut them out of the sheet metal, using: cutoff disk on an angle grinder; bandsaw; beverly shears; or you can file them out with a round file or jeweler's saw. Then, you will want to 
finish the edges up and make them smoother, using either sandpaper or a belt sander to get rid of the sharp edges and leftover material. You should also trim the lames, though this can be done afterwards as well- each lame should be slightly narrower than the one before it to account for the tighter curve.

\
If you wish, you can mark the holes to be drilled and drill them now, or you can do it later after shaping the plates. I prefer doing it after shaping the plates in case my shaping isn't perfect. After this, you want to begin forming them on your dishing stump or dishing forms, hammering the pieces into the dishes in order to create the curvature. I usually start with the shoulder cop- the curve should be quite dramatic. Keep hammering with the round side of a ball peen hammer until you've reached roughly your desired shape.

\
\
Next, you want to begin the same process for the lames, hammering towards the middle of them and sometimes closer to the edges in your dish in order to curve them to the shape of the arm. You can also use a chisel to mark your lames with roman numerals on the inside- this will help you keep track of which is which, as they have to overlap within each other.

\
\
Once finished roughly hammering the shape in, you should be able to clamp the cop and lames together and have them fit and move freely. Now that you've reached this point, mark off your drilling spots (if you did not drill before shaping the plates). There should be 2 holes in each lame, and 4 in the cop. At the top of the cop should be 2 holes for pointing strings, and 2 towards the bottom for attaching to the lames. Each lame should have 1 hole placed on either side- the bottom lame should have an extra rivet below the main one on each side for the tricep straps. You can either place them so that the rivets are obscured, or you can place them so that the rivets are visible on the outside. Placing them with the lames covering the rivet heads may lead to stiff articulation.

\
\
(Optional) If you wish, you can also planish the plates before fitting them. This will give them a smoother appearance and be prettier to look at, but may disrupt your fitting. I planish by hammering the plates on top of a trailer hitch that has been ground flat, using a polished hammer. You want a planishing surface to be flat because it's smoothing out your hammer marks and the shape of the plates.
\
\
(Optional) If using spray paint or some other form of interior finish to prevent rust, you should spray the inside of the armour now, before attaching the leather straps and such. I personally use black rustoleum paint.

# Straps and fitment
Once you finish dishing the shape of your armour, it's time to make the fittings. Clamp all of the plates together, and measure the length from the cop's rivet holes to the top rivet holes on the bottom lames. Cut these lengths of leather/cloth out.

\
\
Place the strap where it should go, and use a sharpie to mark the spots to punch in the leather through the rivet holes in the plate. Then punch holes in the leather using a leather punch. If you don't have a leather punch, you can also use an awl and then drift the hole wider. Once done punching the holes, you can unclamp the plates from each other and begin assembling the spaulder. Start from the bottom lame and work your way up, placing each lame over top of it and finally the cop. To rivet, I use roofing nails. I put nail in from the inside, so that its head is against the leather and the shank is sticking out through the armour. It is highly recommended to place a washer between the nail's head and the leather strap, to keep it from tearing or fraying. Once it's in, cut the rivet to size, and slowly peen it flat into a second rivet head with the flat side of a hammer until it's a tight fit. You can hammer around it with the ball side afterwards to make it rounder and prettier.

\
\
Now, take the measurements of your arm that aren't covered by the spaulder. It should be approximately half the circumference of your tricep. Cut a leather strip to be a bit longer than this length, and then cut it in half leaving some extra material on one of the strips. The strip that's longer will be the buckle side. You can cut the non-buckle strap even longer if you want, to make it more adjustable- this is optional, however. Now punch a hole in the buckle strap for the prong of the buckle to go through, then attach the buckle by folding the strap on itself through the buckle. Punch a hole through both sides of the leather (or 2) and then rivet them together. Punch a hole in the other end of the strap in order to rivet it to the bottom lame of the spaulder. For the other strap, punch a hole in one end to rivet to the lame, and then trim the other end of the strap into a point to make it easier to thread into the buckle. Rivet both straps onto the bottom lame, remembering to use washers.

\
\
Not pictured in the image directly above is that it's recommended to trim both the bottom of the articulation straps (the ones riveted to the cop and lames) and the top of the fitting straps (the ones riveted to the bottom lame with a buckle.) This will help avoid your straps crossing over each other and overlapping.
\
\
After that, the best way to place the notches for the buckle to go through is by wearing it and using a sharpie to mark the dot where it's at the best tightness. It's recommended to punch a couple extra holes in intervals in case it needs to be looser or tighter at any given time. Once this hole is punched, your spaulders should be done and ready to wear. You can also sew a "retainer" onto the buckle side of the strap to hold the excess if needed.
