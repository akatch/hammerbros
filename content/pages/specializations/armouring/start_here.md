## Basic info on Armouring
### Intro
Armouring is a mastery of metalwork, and often considered one of the hardest practices to pursue in metalworking. It requires a lot of practice, as well as a significant amount of study. Anyone can be a good armourer, and anyone can be a great armourer; it does, however, require a large amount of dedication and focus on learning.\
\
To learn armouring, it is heavily recommended to not only practice making the pieces, but to study extants and use other sources to learn as well. There are some notable literature pieces, as well as at least one youtube channel that can be great resources for learning- all of which will be found in the [resources tab](learning_resources.md) of the guide.

### Terminology
The page is written under the assumption that the reader is familiar with all of the terminology. This terminology will be listed here, both for education, and for ease of access. In no particular order:
* Maille- What "Chainmail" is actually called. Chainmail and 'platemail' are both modern misnomers, and inaccurate to the period.
* Planishing- Striking the surface of plates on a flat and polished object, as to smooth out divots and hammer marks in the piece.
* Extant- A surviving historical piece. If a piece of armour in a museum was created during the Renaissance, then it is an armour extant.
* Dishing (also called stretching)- Striking a piece into a "divot" or depression from the inside of the shape to stretch the material (thinning it.) Most often done in forms, but was historically mostly done on flat surfaces.
* Raising (also called shrinking)- Working a sheet from the outside of the shape to push down and compress the material around the apex
* Fluting- Small ridges or corrugations on armour pieces for a decorative (and very mildly functional) effect. Most often done through raising.
* Pointing - "Points" in armour are holes in the armour used to tie them to the body using an arming doublet. This is primarily seen on earlier armours, such as from the 14th century. The doublet would have thick reinforced laces that would go through point holes in certain spots on the plate, and then knotted to secure it to the body.
* Arming doublet- Thick, reinforced doublet, often complete with points and sometimes with maille voiders sewn on where the armour would have gaps (such as armpits.)
* Sliding and leather articulated rivets. Sliding rivets articulate by having slits in the plates they're riveted through to allow the plates to "slide." Leather articulations use leather straps riveted to the inside of the plates. Leather articulations are covered in more detail in the [spaulder tutorial.](making_your_first_armour.md) The top row of rivets in the image below are sliding rivets, while the one outlined in red are leather articulations.
