# Projects for Beginning Blacksmiths
These projects are great for beginners, no matter where your interests lie.

They will also help you understand how hot metal moves and prepare you for more advanced projects. If you're just getting started, try some of these:
- Hooks
- Chisels
- Punches
- Drifts
- Bottle openers
- Nail header and nails
