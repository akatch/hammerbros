# Projects for Beginning Blacksmiths
These projects are great for beginners, no matter where your interests lie. Aside from producing useful objects, they also train fundamental blacksmith skills, like punching and drifting holes and drawing out a clean taper. They will also help you understand how hot metal moves and prepare you for more advanced projects. If you're just getting started, try some of these:
- Hooks
- Chisels
- Punches
- Drifts
- Bottle openers
- Nail header and nails

Check out our [storyboards](/pages/curriculum/storyboards) page for step-by-step forged models of many of these projects to help you get started!
