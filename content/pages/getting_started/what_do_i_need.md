## PPE: Safety first
Eye protection and hearing protection are essential equipment - don't skip this section. Eyeglasses or sunglasses will work, but a pair of dedicated safety glasses or a face shield are better choices. A respirator is generally not required for general forging activities, but is a really good thing to have on hand for [preparing your propane forge for its first use](/pages/equipment/forge_lining), [burning off harmful compounds](), or grinding.

## The Basics: Everything you need to get started
The core requirements for a blacksmith's shop are a hammer, an anvil, and a forge.

Our recommendations:\
### Forges
* [Mr Volcano](https://mrvolcano.com/collections/the-forge)\
* [Just a Box of Dirt (JABOD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-R6iY-mY-Y)\
* [Chili Forge](https://chileforge.com/)

### Anvils
* Large [embedded]() 12lb+ sledge hammer (recommended)
* Any large chunk of steel (search eBay for 1045 steel or ask to purchase at a local machine shop)
* New anvils from [retailer](/pages/equipment/vendors/#anvil-retailers)
[Harbor Freight cast steel anvil (the red one)]()

### Hammers
* 2 lb Nordic Forge rounding hammer [Amazon](https://amazon.com/Nordic-Forge-Lb-Rounding-Hammer/dp/B075LSDGQ4) | [Centaur Forge](https://www.centaurforge.com/Nordic-2-lb-Rounding-Hammer/productinfo/285/))
* Any Brent Bailey hammer (around 2 lbs)
* 2 lb crosspein or rounding hammer

## Nice-to-Haves: Upgrading your shop
Forging with just the basics will get frustrating fast. While it is possible to make tongs without having tongs, there's no shame in buying your first (or first several) set of tongs. If you're on a tight budget, [Ken's Custom Iron tong blanks](https://kensironstore.com/collections/quick-tongs) are a great middle-ground option. A post vise is another excellent upgrade - unlike conventional bench vises, a post vise is designed to stand up to repeated heavy hammering by transferring the force of the hammer blows through the post into the floor.

For folks interested in bladesmithing, a 2x72" belt grinder is essential; the bulk of bladesmithing operations take place at the grinder.

Our recommendations:\
[Ken's Custom Iron Quick Tongs](https://kensironstore.com/collections/quick-tongs)
[2x72" grinder](https://reederproducts.com/)\
[King KDS 1000/6000 grit combination stone](https://www.amazon.com/KDS-Combination-Whetstone-Sharpening-Harder/dp/B01BB1ZDVW)
[King KW65 1000/6000 grit combination stone with plastic base](https://www.amazon.com/KING-KW65-Combination-Whetstone-Plastic/dp/B001DT1X9O)

## Going pro (as in production)
None of the equipment mentioned in this section is needed in a beginner's shop, but if you're looking to produce at scale, you may want to consider investing in a machine or two.\
