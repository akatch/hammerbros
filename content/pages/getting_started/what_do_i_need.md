The most common question we get from new blacksmiths is "what equipment do I need to get started?"

This article hopes to answer that very question.

## PPE

These things are non-optional no matter your budget.

Eye protection and hearing protection are essential equipment - don't skip this section. Eyeglasses or sunglasses will work, but a pair of dedicated safety glasses or a face shield are better choices. A respirator is generally not required for general forging activities, but is a really good thing to have on hand for [preparing your propane forge for its first use][how to line your forge], burning off harmful compounds, or grinding.

* Eye protection - ANSI-rated [face shield][] or safety glasses
* Hearing protection - [earplugs][] or muffs
* Lung protection (for grinding and handling particulates) - P100 or better [respirator][]

## The Basics: Everything you need to get started

The core requirements for a blacksmith's shop are a hammer, an anvil, a forge, and probably some tongs. While it is possible to make tongs without having tongs, there's no shame in buying your first (or first several) set of tongs. If you're on a tight budget, [Ken's Custom Iron tong blanks][] are a great middle-ground option.

These are our core equipment recommendations for every budget.

### Shoestring

Suggestions for those looking to get started as cheaply as possible.

* Hammer: 2-2.5lb (900-1100g) crosspein, rounding, or drilling hammer from your local big box store. Check out our guide to [dressing your hammer][].
* Forge: [Just a Box of Dirt][jabod]
* Anvil: [Sledgehammer head][sledgehammer anvil] or 4140/1045 offcut from eBay or your local steelyard or machine shop
* Tongs: Use long stock or [Ken's Custom Iron tong blanks][].

### Economy

If you've got a little more cash to burn, these options might make your life a little easier.

* Hammer: 2-2.5lb (900-1100g) crosspein, rounding, or drilling hammer from your local big box store. Check out our guide to [dressing your hammer][].
* Forge: [Mr. Volcano single burner][Mr. Volcano forge]
* Anvil: [Harbor Freight cast steel anvil][] or check out our [anvil buying guide][]
* Tongs: 3/8" V-bit bolt jaw or wolf jaw from [Centaur Forge][], [Blacksmiths Depot][], or [Texas Farrier Supply][].

### Premium

Fine goods for the discerning aspiring blacksmith

* Hammer: 2-2.5lb (900-1100g) crosspein or rounding hammer from one of your fellow artists: [Brent Bailey][]
* Forge: [Mr. Volcano single or double burner][Mr. Volcano forge] or [Chile forge][]
* Anvil: [Anvil buying guide][] or buy new from [Texas Farrier Supply][]

## Nice-to-Haves: Upgrading your shop
Forging with just the basics will get frustrating fast. A post vise is an excellent upgrade - unlike conventional bench vises, a post vise is designed to stand up to repeated heavy hammering by transferring the force of the hammer blows through the post into the floor.

For folks interested in bladesmithing, a 2x72" belt grinder is essential; the bulk of bladesmithing operations take place at the grinder.

### Our recommendations:

* Angle grinder
* Post vise
* Chop saw
* Belt grinder [1x30][] | [2x72][]
* [Welder][]

## Going pro (as in production)
None of the equipment mentioned in this section is needed in a beginner's shop, but if you're looking to produce at scale, you may want to consider investing in a machine or two.\

Our recommendations:\
* [TIG welder][]
* Press
* Power hammer
* Heat treat oven
